## Question 1

Take a look at the file labeled `data/data2.txt`. Why might we have missing values or values that state "NO SIGNAL" in this dataset? While we are currently ignoring these values, what might be the risk of filtering these values out?

## Question 2

While the "averages.png" and "maximums.png" graphs visualize typical values in our time-series data of heart rates and subsequently describe similar trends, the "stdevs.png" graph visualizes the standard deviations, which results in a graph with less apparent trends. In the context of heart rate, what does the standard deviation describe?

## Question 3

Run your `main.py` module and look at the graph labeled "averages.png." Roughly speaking, where do you see the time series experience a significant difference in values along the x-axis? Point out all x-values where you notice a drastic difference in future values.

## Question 4

Do you also notice a corresponding difference in values in the "stdevs.png" graph? If so, do these differences align with the "averages.png" graph?
